                    <p>Developing software is mostly about problem-solving at the very core before even writing your first lines of code. You have to identify problems that can be solved using software. Then you have to go on to understand how people try to solve such problems in real life</p>

                    <p>Being a self-taught programmer doesn't mean not to go any school or do not follow any instructor but what it simply means is that when you don't wait for someone to take initiatives on behalf of yourself and get ready to excel the programming skills by any kind of means â€“ whether it be training courses, books, videos.</p>

                    <p>Having good communication skills will help you work well with your team and others through communicating your messages across effectively.Software development is a technical field and developing your technical skills often takes priority over other skills. However, it can be argued that communication skills are equally as important as technical skills.</p>
